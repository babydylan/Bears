            Bears are carnivoran mammals of the family Ursidae. They are classified as caniforms, or doglike
            carnivorans. Although only eight species of bears are extant, they are widespread, appearing in a wide
            variety of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. Bears are
            found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern
            bears include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws
            with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.

            While the polar bear is mostly carnivorous, and the giant panda feeds almost entirely on bamboo, the
            remaining six species are omnivorous with varied diets. With the exception of courting individuals and
            mothers with their young, bears are typically solitary animals. They may be diurnal or nocturnal and have an
            excellent sense of smell. Despite their heavy build and awkward gait, they are adept runners, climbers, and
            swimmers. Bears use shelters, such as caves and logs, as their dens; most species occupy their dens during
            the winter for a long period of hibernation, up to 100 days.
